.. From the highest level, The Game Design Document (GDD) should do two things: 1) Help through design process of the project and 2) communicate the design to the team. In other words, what are the problems that the design is solving and is everyone in agreement on the approach? If this template is not a good format to accomplish these goals, another format should be used, such as a wiki or even a simple slide deck. 

.. Moving forward, if the GDD appears to be a good fit to meet the aforementioned goals, the GDD should be searchable, readable, and concise. The GDD should not be monolithic and include a mass of information just for the sake of completeness. This is just a template and can drastically change based on the project. The most important goal is for the document to be easily understandable for all team member disciplines and to appropriately communicate key points to the reader. The GDD serves as the blueprint for the project and should clearly communicate the vision of the game. 

.. This template was created from many of the key points from https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-to-write-a-game-design-document

.. When working the GDD, keep these points in mind:
..   * Core pillars should be set rigidly to keep the project on-course
..   * The GDD is a living document. We prefer not to try and flush out the entire project at the beginning. Again, set those core concepts only.
..   * Referencing another game is fine, but avoid cloning concepts/mechanics from other games.
..   * Don't be afraid of napkin-quality concept art. 

|Project| Game Design Document (GDD)
====================================

Introduction
------------
.. A brief introduction to the game. Think of this as a sales pitch. Clearly state the vision of the game. Possible sub-sections are laid out below. If the sub-sections are left in, this area may remain blank.

Vision Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. What is the game and why it will interesting/fun. What makes it unique?

Logline
~~~~~~~
.. A single-sentence description of the game.

Gameplay Synopsis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. A couple of paragraphs of the core gameplay and the structure.

Goals
-----
.. Goals serve as a beacon to keep the project headed in the right direction. Things can quickly change and the direction of the game can deviate away from the original intent. Keep goals in mind to make sure these changes don't derail the project. Some goal examples are list below. These can be added to/removed/edited. 

Player Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. What do you want the player to feel as they play the game? How will these experiences be implemented?

Game World
----------
.. What is the overall world of the game? How will players traverse/experience it? Will these be levels or be an open-world? Providing concept art will be useful. This section should set the mood and does not have to be real shots of the final product. If the game will have mountains, oceans, villages, etc, we can show representative scenes here.

Mechanics
---------
.. Mechanics are how the player will interact with the game and how the game will respond to those interactions. Words my suffice but other forms of communication here may be useful, such as story boards, charts, videos, etc. This can possibly be condensed down to a single illustrated page that represents the core gameplay loop and progressions.

Characters
----------
.. Any characters in the game should be represented here. Who are they and what is there role in the game? A character web may be useful to show the character's relationships. Rough concept art will go a long way here. 

Story
-----
.. Not all games have a story so this sections may not even need to be updated. If the story is small, something simple like a logline will be fine. If the game is going to implement a rich story, it should be well fleshed out in this section. For rich storylines, it is likely that other documents will be created, such as other outlines, scripts, etc. Those should be linked in this section.

User Interface
--------------
.. Lists and diagrams can go a long way in communicating the various interfaces and their flow. Visual aids that represent the various screens will help to convey the ideas to the UX designers. A media list of the icons/assets that need to be created will also be helpful. 

Audio
-----
.. Outline some high-level notes on the sounds and music of the game. Again, a media list may be useful here. How many pieces of music will be needed? How many various sound effects will need to be created? Will the project need voice actors?

Prototype
---------
.. For the GDD, the prototype here can either be a paper-prototype or it could be made in-engine. A paper-prototype may be faster to create as compared to one created with a game engine. The prototypes can be fully shown in this document, or just refer to links that hold the implementation elsewhere. We can also organize the prototypes that we desire by highest to lowest importance.
